# 🎮 Simon Game

A classic memory game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to repeat the sequence of colors shown by the game. Each round adds one more color to the sequence, testing your memory and reflexes!

## 🧠 How to Play

1. Click **Start** or press any key to begin the game.
2. Watch the sequence of blinking buttons and sounds.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the **exact same order**.
4. With each correct round, the sequence gets longer.
5. One mistake ends the game. Try to beat your high score!
